3. You should be able to edit or delete rows in place.All the Data which comes from api is added using Local Storage Mechanism and when all the data is selected when delete button is clicked, add is removed from Local Storage.

4. You need to implement pagination: Each page contains 10 rows. Buttons at the bottom allow you to jump to any page including special buttons for first page, previous page, next page and last page. Pagination must update based on search/filtering.

5. You should be able to select one or more rows. Multiple selected rows can be deleted at once using the 'Delete Selected' button at the bottom left.

6. Checkbox on the top left is a shortcut to select or deselect all displayed rows. This should only apply to the ten rows displayed in the current page, and not all 50 rows.
